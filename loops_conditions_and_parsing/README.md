# 5. Bad Luck for 4, Good Luck for 8

This Bash script loops from 1 to 10 and displays a different message based on the iteration number:

- Prints **"bad luck"** on the 4th iteration  
- Prints **"good luck"** on the 8th iteration  
- Prints **"Best School"** on all other iterations  

It demonstrates the use of `while` loops with `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Bash.

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x 5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance
